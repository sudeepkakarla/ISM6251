Here be a short description and some technical information , take from the accompany documentation : DMPEG V1.0 Public Domain MPEG decoder by Stefan Eckart 0 . Features =========== DMPEG/DMPLAY be another MPEG decoder/player for the PC : - decodes ( nearly ) the full MPEG video standard ( I , P , B frames , frame size up to at least 352x240 support ) - save decode sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decode ( require VGA ) - several dither option : order dither , Floyd-Steinberg , grayscale - color-space selection - run under DOS , 640KB RAM , no MS-Windows require - very compact ( small code / small data model , 16 bit arithmetic ) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for VGA and many Super-VGAs ... 4 . Technical information ======================== The player be a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [ 1 ] . The IDCT be base on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [ 2 ] ( not quite the optimum , I know ) . Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficient use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT ( sound great , do n't it ? ) , which turn out to be faster than a 'fast ' algorithm in this ( quite common ) case . Dithering be pretty standard . Main difference to the Berkeley decoder ( except for the fewer number of supported algorithm ) be the use of 256 instead of 128 color , the ( default ) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant order dither . This lead to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image ( I claim , judge yourself ) . Restricted color-space mean that the U and V component be clip to +/-0.25 ( instead of +/-0.5 ) and the display color-space point be distribute over this restricted space . Since the distance between color-space point be thus reduce by a factor of two , the color resolution be double at the expense of not be able to represent fully saturate color . Saturation dominant order dither be a method by which a color , lie somewhere between the point of the display color space , be approximate by primarily alternate between two point of constant hue instead of constant saturation . This yield subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation change than to hue change ( the same reasoning as use by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC ) . The improvement be particularly visible in dark brown or redish area . ... -- Stefan Eckart , stefan @ lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de \",\n",

First , we need to check if the line and the polygon be separate . Now , the Jordan curve separation theorem say that the polygon divide the plane into exactly two open ( and thus non-compact ) region . Thus , the line lie completely inside the polygon , the line lie completely outside the polygon , or possibly ( but this will rarely happen ) the line intersect the polyon . Now , the phrasing of this question say `` if a line intersect a polygon '' , so this be a decision problem . One possibility ( the decision model approach ) be to reduce the question to some other ( well know ) problem Q , and then try to solve Q . An answer to Q give an answer to the original decision problem . In recent year , many geometric problem have be successfully model in a new language call PostScript . ( See `` PostScript Language '' , by Adobe Systems Incorporated , ISBN # 0-201-10179-3 , co. 1985 ) . So , give a line L and a polygon P , we can write a PostScript program that draw the line L and the polygon P , and then `` output '' the answer . By `` output '' , we mean the program execute a command call `` showpage '' , which actually print a page of paper contain the line and the polygon . A quick examination of the paper provide an answer to the reduce problem Q , and thus the original problem . There be two small problem with this approach . ( 1 ) There be an infinite number of way to encode L and P into the reduce problem Q . So , we will be force to invoke the Axiom of Choice ( or equivalently , Zorn 's Lemma ) . But the use of the Axiom of Choice be not regard in a very serious light these day . ( 2 ) More importantly , the question arise as to whether or not the PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper ; or in other word , will it halt ? Now , PostScript be expressive enough to encode everything that a Turing Machine might do ; thus the halting problem ( for PostScript ) be undecidable . It be quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable . I will n't even begin to go into other difficulty , such as aliasing , finite precision and run out of ink , paper or both . A couple of reference might be : 1 . Principia Mathematica . Newton , I.

Organization : AT & T Bell Laboratories , Murray Hill NJ The situation be not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggest ( he should know better , he 's hung around The Labs for long enough ) . By the well know Dobbin-Dullman reduction ( see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin , J. Comp . Obfusc . 37 , ii : pp . 33-947 , lemma 17 ( a ) ) line-polygon intersection can be reduce to Hamiltonian Circuit , without ( ! ) the use of Grobner base , so LPI ( to coin an acronym ) be probably only NP-complete . Besides , Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 be deliver , since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 millisecond ( with scatter-gather . ) -- -- -- -- From : deb @ svax.cs.cornell.edu ( David Baraff ) Well , sure its no worse than NP-complete , but that 's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfy a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative . ( I think there 's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that deal with this ) . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- J o n a s Y n g v e s s o n email : jonas-y @ isy.liu.se Dept . of Electrical Engineering voice : +46- ( 0 ) 13-282162 University of Linkoping , Sweden fax : +46- ( 0 ) 13-139282 \",\n",

The first one be Ray ( or half line ) method . In this method , you can draw any ray , if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon be even , then it be outside . If the number be odd , then it be inside . Of cause , you have to deal with the special case which may make you headache . The second method be PI algorithm . Draw the line between the point and all the vertex on the polygon . Calculate and sum the angle of the successive line . If the result be 2 * PI , then it be inside . If PI , then it be on the polygon . Otherwise it be outside . My experience tell the second method be relible . Hope this help . Yeh USC ',\n",

It depend upon how serious you be and how advanced your application be . True immersive visualization ( VR ) , require the rendering of complex visual database at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly render frame per second . This be a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulator for pilot training . If the frame rate be too low , the user notice the stepping of the frame as they move their head rapidly around the scene , so the motion of the graphic be not smooth and contiguous . Thus the graphic system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rate while render complex data representation . Additionally , the frame rate must be constant . If the system render 15 frame per second at one point , then 60 frame per second the next ( perhaps due to the scene in the new view direction be simpler than what be visible before ) , the user can get heavily distract by the medium ( the graphic computer ) rather than focus on the data . To maintain a constant frame rate , the system must be able to run in real-time . UNIX in general do not support real-time operation , but Silicon Graphics have modify the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor system to be able to support real-time operation , bypass the usual UNIX process priority-management scheme . Uniprocessor system run UNIX can not fundamentally support real-time operation ( not Sun SPARC10 , not HP 700 Series system , not IBM RS-6000 , not even SGI 's uniprocessor system like Indigo or Crimson ) . Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge system support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing ( SMP ) shared-memory architecture . From a graphic perspective , render complex virtual environment require advanced render technique like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing . Of all of the general purpose graphic system on the market today , only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 system fully support these capability . The anti-aliasing be particularly important , as the crawl jag edge of aliased polygon be an unfortunate distraction when immerse in a virtual environment . | > What kind of graphic language be use with VR | > ( GL , opengl , Phigs , PEX , GKS , etc. ) ?

       " \"Hi everyone , I think that some people may be interested in my VR software on these group : * * * * * * * Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2 * * * * * * * Multiverse be a multi-user , non-immersive , X-Windows base Virtual Reality system , primarily focus on entertainment/research . Features : Client-Server base model , use Berkeley Sockets . No limit to the number of user ( apart from performance ) . Generic client . Customizable server . Hierachical Objects ( allow attachment of camera and light source ) . Multiple light source ( ambient , point and spot ) . Objects can have extension code , to handle unique functionality , easily attach . Functionality : Client : The client be build around a 'fast ' render loop . Basically it change thing when tell to by the server and then render an image from the user 's viewpoint . It also provide the server with information about the user 's action - which can then be communicate to other client and therefore to other user . The client be design to be generic - in other word you do n't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world . This mean that resource can be spend on enhance the client software rather than adapt it . The adaptation , as will be explain in a moment , occur in the server . This release of the client software support the following functionality : o Hierarchical Objects ( with associate address ) o Multiple Light Sources and Types ( Ambient , Point and Spot ) o User Interface Panels o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading ( optional wireframe for faster frame rate ) o Mouse and Keyboard Input ( Some people may be disappoint that this software do n't support the PowerGlove as an input device - this be not because it can n't , but because I do n't have one ! This will , however , be one of the first enhancement ! ) Servers : This be where customization can take place . The follow basic support be provide in this release for potential world server developer : o Transparent Client Management o Client Message Handling This may not sound like much , but it take away the headache of accept and terminate client and receive message from them - the application writer can work with the assumption that thing be happen locally . Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality . This be what be provide to allow you to animate your object : o Server Selectable Extension Installation : What this mean be that you can decide which object have extend functionality in your world . Basically you call the extension initialisers you want . o Event Handler Registration : When you develop extension for an object you basically write callback function for the event that you want the object to respond to . ( Current event support : INIT , MOVE , CHANGE , COLLIDE & TERMINATE ) o Collision Detection Registration : If you want your object to respond to collision event just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software . Your callback will be activate when a collision occur . This software be keep separate from the worldServer application because the application developer want to build a library of extended object from which to choose . The following be all you need to make a World Server application : o Provide an initWorld function : This be where you choose what object extension will be support , plus any initialization you want to do . o Provide a positionObject function : This be where you determine where to place a new client . o Provide an installWorldObjects function : This be where you load the world ( .wld ) file for a new client . o Provide a getWorldType function : This be where you tell a new client what persona they should have . o Provide an animateWorld function : This be where you can go wild ! At a minimum you should let the object move ( by call a move function ) and let the server sleep for a bit ( to avoid outrun the client ) . That 's all there be to it ! And to prove it here be the line count for the three world server I 've provide : generic - 81 line dactyl - 270 line ( more complicate collision detection due to the stair ! Will probably be improve with future version ) dogfight - 72 line Location : This software be locate at the following site : ftp.u.washington.edu Directory : pub/virtual-worlds File : multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z Futures : Client : o Texture mapping . o More realistic rendering : i.e . Z-Buffering ( or similar ) , Gouraud shade o HMD support . o Etc , etc .... Server : o Physical Modelling ( gravity , friction etc ) . o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction o Etc , etc .... Both : o Improved Comms ! ! !

If you have problem , feel free to contact me . The other change be that I remove the FastPerfTrig call from the FPU version to make it run faster .

Did n't you always want to write this program that visualize the structure of three-dimensional molecule ? And do n't the task of write your 3D conversion routine keep you from actually do it ? Well if the answer to any of the above question be 'Yes , but what have it to do with this package ? ? ? ' , read on . GrafSys be a THINK Pascal/C library that provide you with simple routine for building , save , load ( as resource ) , and manipulate ( independent rotate around arbitrary achses , translate and scale ) three dimensional object . Objects , not just simple single-line drawing . GrafSys support full 3D clipping , animation and some ( primitive ) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple command from within YOUR PROGRAM . GrafSys also support full eye control with both perspective and parallel projection ( If you can n't understand a word , do n't worry , this be just show off for those who know about it . The doc that come with it will try to explain what it all mean later on ) . GrafSys provide a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routine with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformation and your own routine to do the actual drawing . ( Note that GrafSys also provide draw routine so you do n't have to worry about that if you do n't want to ) GrafSys 1.11 come in two version . One for the 881 and 020 or above processor . The other version use fixed-point arithmetic and run on any Mac . Both version be * 100 % source compatibel * . GrafSys come with an extensive manual that teach you the fundamental of 3D graphic and how to use the package . If demand be big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library . However , I feelt that the way it be implement now make it easier to use for a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild ' . GrafSys be free for any non-commercial usage .

As one of the previous post state , the Personal IRIS be introduce in 1988 and grow to include the 4D/20 , 4D/25 , 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rate speed up over time . As a rule of thumb , SGI platforms live for about 4-5 year . This be true of the motorola-based 3000 series ( '85-'89 ) , the PI ( '88-'93 ) , the Professional Series ( the early 4D 's - '86-'90 ) , the Power Series parallel system ( '88-'93 ) . Individual CPU subsystems run at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 year . New graphic architectures at the high end ( GT , VGX , RealityEngine ) be release every 18 month to 2 year . These be the fact of life . If we look at these machine , they become almost archaic after four year , and we have to come out with a new platform ( like Indigo , Onyx , Challenge ) which have higher bus bandwidth , faster CPUs , faster graphic and I/O , and larger disk capacity . If we do n't , we become uncompetitive . From the user perspective , you have to buy a machine that meet your current need and make economic sense today . You can n't wait to buy , but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine , ask the Sales Rep for one in writing . If it 's feasible , they should be able to do that . Some of our upgrade path have specific program associate with them , such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing system which allow purchaser of those system to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for move to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor system . | > | > Now I understand that SGI be responsible to its investor and have to | > keep show a positive quarterly bottom line ( odd that I find myself | > pressure on at least two occasion to get the business on the book | > just before the end of the quarter ) , but I 'm just a little tired of | > get bone in the process . | > If that 's happen , it 's becausing of misunderstanding or mis-communication , not because SGI be directly attempt to annoy our customer base . | > Maybe it 's because my lab buy SGIs in onesies and twosies , so we | > be n't entitle to a `` peek under the cover '' as the Big Kids ( NASA , | > for instance ) be .

Most SGI customer be onesy-twosey type , but regardless , we rarely give a great deal of notice when we be about to introduce a new system because again , like a previous post state , if we pre-announced and the schedule slip , we would mess up our potential customer schedule ( when they be count on the availability of the new system on a particular date ) and would also look awfully bad to both our investor and the financial analyst who watch us most carefully to see if we be meet our commitment . | > The box that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the | > entire grant period of five year and , in some case , beyond .

New processor technology be arrive every 1-2 year , make a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generation behind the time . The competitive nature of the market be demand that rate of development , so if your timing be really 5 year between purchase , you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor . There be some reality about the computer biz that we all have to live with , but keep customer happy be the most important , so do n't give up , we know it .

       " \"A very kind soul have mail me this reply for the bug in CView . Since he be n't in the position to post this himself , he ask me to post it for him , but to leave his name out . So here it come : CView have quite a number of bug . The one you mention be perhaps the most annoying , but not the most dangerous . As far as I can determine , it have to do with the temp file that CView create . CView give the user no control over where it place its temp file : it just place them in its `` current directory '' . The problem you mention occurs ( as far as I can tell ) when it run out of disk space for its temp file . It seem as if CView do n't check properly for this situation . As Cview decode a jpeg , it seem to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information . Then , for 8 bit display , it do the `` dithering '' , again write another file with the 8 bit colour information . While it be write this second file , it also write the data to your colour card . Then when it do the last chunk of 8 bit data , it recopy all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again . ( It do this last `` recopy '' operation for its `` fit to screen '' feature , even when this feature be not enable . ) The result of this process be the following : 1 ) If it run out of disk space when write the first 24 bit file , all you ever see be as much data as it have room for , and the last bit of data be simply repeat over and over again because CView never realize the disk have fill up and disk writes/reads be n't perform . 2 ) If it have enough room for the 24 bit data , but run out of room for the 8 bit data , you see almost all of the picture as it do the dithering and write to the screen card . However , then when it finish the dithering and recopy the data from the 8 bit file to screen ( for whatever reason it do this ) one again just get a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there be room on the disk . This be just a guess , but probably fairly accurate . At least the general idea be on track I think , although I have probably make error in detail about file I/O etc . The way around this be of course to clear up sufficient disk space . The temp file for large JPEG 's ( 1200x900 and bigger ) can be very large ( 3 Meg + 1 Meg ) . On some of the largest I have need in excess of 6 Meg free disk space . CView have a much more serious bug : if you be try to display a file from a floppy , and you change floppy while CView have some temp file open on the floppy , then CView in certain circumstance will write the directory ( and FAT table ? I can n't remember ) for the remove floppy onto the newly insert floppy , thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious , possibly unrevcoverable way . SO BE CAREFUL ! It be incredibly poor program for a program to do this . On the other hand , when choose file in the Open Files menu , CView insist on do a few disk read every time one move the hi-lighter square . Incredibly annoy when it could do them all at once when it get the directory info . And really , how much effort do it take to sort a directory listing ?

       " 'What be the main advantage of this method ? I have see it describe , and the algiorithm seem a little bit long . I develop my own method , which require that the point be in a counter-clockwise order , and return whether you be look at the back or the front , similar to the plane eqn method . It use few calculation however , basically it be several comparison . The only disadvantage I see be that it must be do after the transformation from view coordinate to coordinate to display on the screen , which mean that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand . My method basically figure out whether the point that will appear on the screen be clockwise or counterclockwise . When look at the back of something , the point occur in an opposite direction from the front , so merely by figure out which way the point go , you can tell whether you be look at the back or front of a 2d polygon .

If playoff hockey be any more intense than the regular season variety then it be because the team be face each other at least 4 consecutive time in 7 day and hockey be the contact sport that it be , some thing will be carry over that might dissipate during the regular season . But that be only for some of the player . Many of the rest , who have be play with injury , who miss their family , or who , like Grant Fuhr , would really rather be play golf , do n't really give a damn . Of course I can n't say this for sure , but I believe that this be fairly typical of human nature and I do n't think that hockey player be above have what I consider typically human attitude . With the recent salary escalation the key player be actually lose money by participate in the playoff . The one who regard the playoff `` take '' as some kind of a bonanza be fringe player who be unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoff . Now I know some of you be go to come back with `` win spirit '' and all of that crap but these player be professional after all . While they may love to play the game that love be entirely incidental to their purpose , which be , to make a decent living . Of course , the coach be a professional as well , and part of what he be be pay to do be motivate the player . So , if the coach do his job well enough the player may respond with a win effort . The second season , be after all , merely an exhibition . The true Champions of the league be the division winner , the team that come out on top after the long struggle of the season . The Stanley cup playoff merely accord victory to the team that have remain healthy and `` hot '' . The emphasis on the playoff , with their `` sudden death '' appeal have be promote by the medium and the owner with profit purely in mind . Even if Pittsburgh lose the playoff , we all know that they be really the best team in the league over the year .

He come highly tout as a defensive defenseman , but he 's clearly much more than that . Great skater and hard shot ( though wish he be more accurate ) . In fact , he pretty much allow the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey . Kelly Hrudey be only the biggest disappointment if you think he be any good to begin with . But , at best , he 's only a mediocre goaltender .

Other than that , the award go to Robert Lang , an uninspiring Czech . Robitaille could easily be MVP , but I 'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who be quietly become one of the league 's premier defensemen , and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense , it could one day mean that we 'll let in fewer goal than Hartford .

Of course my question be this .... how will the Leafs fare when they be once again `` healthy '' if they be play this well so far ? ? Second , just look at their standing , still second in defence , move from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month , have n't lose at home in last 12 game , 8 game undefeated streak .. etc .

It deny young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead give it to Europeans , who be n't even well hockey player . It 's all hype .

There 's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several `` crucial '' market like Germany , Italy and France while Sweden and Finland probably can n't afford to shell out $ 20- $ 30 for ticket the way American/Canadian fan do . Call it `` the Minnesota North Stars '' effect : Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local , inexpensive hockey to the NHL . The National Hockey League should love the idea , though .

Soderstrom : Absolutely . 4 shutout in 39 game for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him . Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who be score a ton over their career best . But Galley think he 's Paul Coffey ( put score ahead of defend ) and Fedyk have tail off big time . Eklund : Was a big question mark this year and be come off injury . 42 point in 49 game be not bad at all , and recently he 's be a huge factor in the win they 've get . Eklund have never have a point a game season in his career , his production be very typical for him . How do he qualify as a disappointment ? If anything he 's a surprise . My choice would be Roussel if I go strictly by what be expect of player , but I never think that he have what it take to be a # 1 goalie . My biggest disappointment be Bill Dineen . I think that he be go to be the perfect coach for this young team , instead he 's make too many bad move and IMHO have cost them enough game to keep them out of the playoff this year . Any coach that think put Eric Lindros at the point on power play be a bright idea need to go back to coach school . pete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mail list owner \",\n",
       " \"The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night show up at the Spectrum Sunday night , and dominate the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout . Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout , but he barely break a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense keep the Leafs from mount any serious attack . Injuries : Pelle Eklund be day-to-day with a bruised thigh . Roster Moves : Jason Bowen be add to the lineup for his first NHL game . Jason be the FLYERS second pick in the first round ( 15th overall ) of the 1992 entry draft . 19 year old , 6 ' 4 '' , 210 lb . In 62 game with the tri-city Americans he have 10 goal , 12 assist and 219 PIM . He play leave wing and defense , he play defense in this game although Bobby Taylor say that Bill Dineen be plan to use him up front as well . Andre Faust be return to Hershey . He actually leave after the second period of the Kings game , fly to Albany , get the game tie goal in a Bears OT win , and play again for Hershey Sunday night . Lines : Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen Tommy Soderstrom in goal . Acton replace Lomakin in the 3rd period . Game Summary : If the FLYERS play like this every night , they 'd be in the playoff this year . The FLYERS hit everything that move . They create score chance after score chance . They snuff out everything that the Leafs try to do . Jason Bowen make a good play on his first NHL shift that almost create a goal . He have the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone , but instead of take the shot he find Brind'Amour crash the net on the other side . A perfect pas and a good shot across Daren Puppa 's body should have be a goal , but Puppa make a great save read the play . Garry Galley give the Maple Leafs 7th rank power play the first chance when he hook Doug Gilmour at 4:25 . The FLYERS lowly 21st rank penalty kill unit be almost flawless the entire game , and set the tone on this kill . The Maple Leafs get almost nothing but long unscreened shot , and the defense sweep away every rebound . After the power play , the FLYERS get a goal on an ugly play . Rod Brind'Amour give the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point , and he send a drive at the net . Puppa make the save and kick the rebound right into the foot of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse , who be wrestle in the slot . Beranek be able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who be skate into the slot from the right circle , and he lift a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10 . The FLYERS keep the pressure on , and Puppa be the only Leaf keep the FLYERS from build on their lead for a while . Eventually thing settle down and defense prevail . Each team get an occasional scoring chance , but the goalie be strong . Bowen start give some Lindros-like check in his own corner . Then Lindros , who be look to avenge a hit Foligno give him , think he have a chance to even the score . He have Foligno line up at center ice , lean into him , and ride him into the center ice board . The only problem be that Foligno be a little far from the board , and Mike `` Mister '' McGeough felt that it warrant a boarding call at 15:38 The Leafs could n't get anything go on the power play as the FLYERS be very aggressive ( for a change ) on the kill . With time run out in the period , Recchi carry through the neutral zone and hand to Lindros as they approach the Leaf 's blue line . They be in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun , Lindros try a backhand pas to Recchi through the foot of Macoun that connect to Recchi , but then Clark check Recchi off the puck . Macoun then try to clear , but it be weak and go right to McGill who have man the point . He drive it from just inside the blue line . Macoun get his stick on it and deflect it past his own goalie at 19:55.1 . Shots be 13-8 FLYERS in the period . The FLYERS finally get their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk trip up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone . During the power play , the FLYERS get cheat a little when the puck pop up into the air and Eric gloved it down , but McGeough think it hit his stick above his head . We could see from our seat at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirm , but the faceoff go to the other end . As time be run out in the advantage , Lindros find Galley with a pas across the goal mouth but Puppa make the save . The rebound kick back to the right corner where Recchi pick it up , pass it out to Eric crash through the right circle , and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55 . With the assist , Recchi move past Bobby Clarke 's 74-75 season , the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117 . Eric move up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie score with 67 point . Mike Eastwood take down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play . Not much pressure before Garry Galley end the power play with a slash at 9:19 . Not much happen on the 4 on 4 , although the Leafs have most of the possession . The FLYERS smother the Leafs short power play . Tempers flare a little at 13:14 . Bowen and Pearson get rough minor , Keith Acton get a bloody face . Dave McLlwain then take a dive and get Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3 . The replay show that Hawgood 's stick stop make contact with McLlwain long before he spin around and fell . Again the FLYERS smother the Leafs power play , lead by Dimitri Yushkevich . Bowen make a thundering hit when he come out of the box on Pearson . Berehowski try to perplex everybody with his sloooowball . He have the puck at the point , and just trickle a pas down the slot . He make all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it , and it get to Gilmour at the side of the net , but Soderstrom stone him . The FLYERS pick thing up offensively after the kill be over , but do n't get anything home . Shots be 13-10 FLYERS . The FLYERS be content with the 3 goal lead in the third period , and they decide that if Tommy want a shutout , he be go to have to work for it a little . The FLYERS get most of the scoring chance in the first 7 or so minute of the period , but could n't get past Puppa . Then the Leafs get tire of Lindros make road kill out of them , and temper flare . 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros ( unsportsmanlike conduct ) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill ( rough ) all at 7:02 . Terry Carkner then take a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour . Again the FLYERS smother the Leafs power play . At about the 12 minute mark , Dave Andreychuk get a shot away from his left circle that get through Soderstrom . The puck be roll on it 's side , and as luck would have it it turn away from the net instead of turn towards it ( think of how a rolling quarter inevitably start to lean one way or the other ) . Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour trip up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play . On the advantage , after Soderstrom stone Andreychuk while lie down , Andreychuk get the rebound through Soderstrom , but from behind the net and it go straight through and be sweep away by one of his defensemen . They keep the pressure on , but Soderstrom be equal and preserve the shutout . Recchi cross check Ken Baumgartner to get temper hot and start a brawl at 16:01 . No punch thrown , Recchi get the initial minor , Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each get roughing minor . At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek express their mutual dislike for each other and get 2 each for slash to set up another 4 on 4 . Mike Eastwood shove down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they be battle for the puck , and while McGill be down he run his stick across McGill 's face . The FLYERS be not happy with that at all . 5-8 Al Conroy pair up with 6-1 Berehowski , and start throw punch . Upward . Well , Al hold his own , much to the delight of the crowd . Each get a couple punch in before go down in a head , and Al get a stand O ! Penalties : Eastwood 5 ( cross check ) + game , Clark , Carkner 10 each . Berehowski and Conroy 5 each ( fight ) at 17:49 . So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS . The have no interest in stting on the lead . Hawgood , Galley and Brind'Amour play catch until Hawgood find Dineen all alone in the left circle , he control the puck and blast it past Puppa at 18:39 . That be all the firework , Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot . Puppa do , but keep the FLYERS off the board . 4-0 FLYERS , shot be 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd . Probably the strongest game I 've see from the FLYERS since the All Star break . Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom , all since 1/10 . Tied for 2nd most in the NHL , but he 's played fewer game than Belfour ( 6 ) or the goalie I can n't remember that he 's tie with . Next up it 's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg . The FLYERS can not be eliminate if they win , but a loss couple with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end . FLYERS up to 71 point on the season in 78 game . Last year they have 75 point in 80 game ( 5 under .500 ) , so they need at least 8 point in their last 6 game to improve on that only by percentage point ( 5 under in 84 be better than 5 under in 80 ) . Tragic number hold at 3 point with 6 game leave . The tragic number for 5th be 5 point , I watch the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finish this up . Why 5 point instead of 4 ? Well , the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them , whereas the Islanders win tie breaker against the FLYERS and so need only a tie . The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils , the Pens twice , the FLYERS , and finish up with 2 game against the Caps . So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on .

He fan on 25 % of goal mouth feed , but he still have 36 goal after a terrible start and have be an examplary ( sp ? ) team captain throughout a tough couple of season . Honorable mention : Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens . Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP , but Kypreos ( 17 goal , 320+ PIM ) have be the hardest work player on the team and Janssens be underrate as a defensive center and checker . I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determine value . Biggest surprise : Geoff Sanderson . He have 13 goal and 31 point last season as a center , then move to leave wing and have so far put up 45 goal and 80+ point . He now have a new Whaler record 21 power play goal , most all come from the right wing faceoff circle , his garden spot . Honorable mention : Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake . The kiddie quartet of Sanderson , Poulin , Nylander , and Petrovicky have be attract the most attention , but Cassels be just 23 and will score close to 90 point this season . He have quite nicely assume the role of number one center on the team and work very well with Sanderson . Yake bounce around the minor for a number of season but be still 24 and will put up about 20 goal and 50 point this season . Yake , like Sanderson , start perform well offensively once he be convert from center to wing , although lefty Sanderson go to the left wing and righty Yake go to the right side . Biggest disappointment : Hands down , John Cullen . Cullen have a disasterous 77 point season last year , his first full season after The Trade . Cullen start the season off of summer back surgery , and fell flat on his face ( appropriate , since he spend all of his Whaler career flat on his as , and whine about it ) . Cullen score just 9 point on 19 game , be a clubhouse malcontent , command the powerplay to a 9 % success percentage ( > 21 % with Sanderson ) , and sulk his way out of town . Worst of all , his 4 year , $ 4M contract have three year leave to run , so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offer to Hartford . Honorable mention : Steve Konroyd , also subpar after sign a 3 year , $ 2.1M contract ; Eric Weinrich , who show flash of competence , but overall have play poorly ; Jim McKenzie , who be a much better hockey player two season ago than he be now ; and Frank Pietrangelo , who only seem to play well when Sean Burke be out for an extended period and he get to make a number of start in a row . -SG ( a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder ) -steveg @ cadkey.com ',\n",

Lemieux say he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year . I know there be many non-cultural reason behind these but there be more : - Some american player who play for the Expos complain about the french fact and that the city be not quite like the other US city . One player ' wife try to make her point go on to complain that she could not even find her favorite brand of nacho chip in Montreal .

Foul ( Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick ) . If you get 5 you be out for the game . 2 . Unsportsmanlike contact . ( An intentional foul ) . This inlcludes all the current flavour of roughing , fight and board . If you get two you be throw out of the game , and fin . 3 . Technical foul . Bad mouth the ref , by player or coach . Penalty shot be award . Two and you be throw out of the game . Besides the penalty shot for one technical , if the team get 5 penalty in a period , the oppose team get a penalty shot for every additional one , until the end of the period . The victim get two shot if he/she be in the act of shoot when the foul ocured . This work well for several reason . First , penalty shot be the most exciting thing in hockey , right ? So , it follow that the more the better . Next , when the player be set up for a penalty shot , the network can take a commercial . Finally , with only three penalty , the network announcer ( Don Meredith , Dick Vitale , John Madden , Pat Summerall , and Marv Levy , among others ) will be able to tell the viewer what happen before the PA announcer say it . Oh , one other rule . When a goal be score ( 10-20 time a period ) , the play can not resume until the PA announcer announce it . This way , the network can sneak in a few more commercial . Then , once the PA announcer have tell them who score , the TV announcer can tell you the viewer , and even have a chance of pronounce his name right . Seriously , though , I actually go to see a NBA basketball game last week , for the first time in my life . I be amaze how boring it be . The play be so slow they actually have fan come out for thing like free-throw shoot contest DURING THE PERIOD ! . Of course the 'Laker Girls ' get to do their routine at least 6-8 time during the game , and not just between period either . There be a whistle every 30 second on average , maybe less . The game be 48 minute , with 2 minute between quarter 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime , and it still take over 2 hour . The reason for this have to be TV . There be plenty of room to throw in commercial , and have the announcer jabber while nothing else be happen . On TV , basketball be fairly entertaining , IMHO . But , it be well to watch it on TV than to be there . If this be the road the NHL be follow , then it truly be a sad day . Enough for now . dvb \",\n",

I 've also notice that he usually get away with it . Just as example last night , I notice him elbow Scott Stevens in the head , which basically start the whole shoving match that get Stevens ( Scott ) and Tocchet 2 minute minor . He also KICKED John McLean . Of course he be n't call for that . Is n't kick an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension ? I think Glenn Anderson get one a few year ago for kick Gaetan Duchesne in the chest . There 's no doubt in my mind that Barasso be the dirtiest golatender since Hextall . He 's also very good .

I saw him play in the Swedish championship game for junior player this year , and he play very well , a physical game , but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie do ( I suspect you would like to have a Ulf type-of-player on the B 's team too ? : ) As for Mariusz Czerkawski , he have have a * great * season for Hammarby in division 1 . He score -if I remember correctly- 93 point this season , and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden be consider * very good * due to the limited number of game . Mariusz be Djurgarden property ( he be just on loan to Hammarby ) , so he will play in Elitserien next season , unless the B 's can get him of course .

       " \"Well , the Patrick Division get a little more interesting last night . The Islanders lose in OT and the Devils tie the Pens . That mean if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday , the will meet the Caps in the playoff . However , I have some more comment on the Islanders and hockey in general that I need to get off my chest : ) . First of all , with the Islanders back-to-back lackluster performance against the Whalers , one may think that the Islanders be out of shape . These guy always suck wind in the 2nd period , come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon . It be unbelieveable how many one goal game these guy have lose . Anyway , the game be pretty wide open . The Isles still have ton of trouble score . The Whalers play a golie in be 1st NHL start , I think his name be Lenarduzzi ( sp ? ) . ( His NHL debut be the Tuesday tie against the Isles ) . Like I mention before , this guy look like the best golie on the planet for a while ( until he misplay a Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT ) . I say it 's because the Isles do n't shoot correctly . Has anyone else notice this ? Also , I think it be really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota get as much ice time as he do . This guy have about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald ( who do play hockey , I think ) . Anytime he get the puck it get steal , and he always start fight and get needless penalty . Richard Pilon be another guy who be on the ice to stir up crap . And he 's a defenseman . He 's get to be approach negative infinity for his plus/minus . This guy get beat all the time . Why the need for such `` enforcer '' ? Not only do fight slow the game down ALOT , but it take away from the guy who be really try to play the game . I 'll be one of the few to admit , I do enjoy a good fight once in a while , but only when it 's `` call for '' . You know , when a guy check the goalie too hard . In other word , a violation of `` hockey ethic '' might cause you to get puched . But there be no need to start crap when you be lose or becuase you can get away with it ! ! Does anyone agree that referee need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT ? I mean COME ON already . I 'm sick of see team pull guy down , hold guy etc . just becuase the referee do n't call it . OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy , not physical prowess . Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost . If you be so afraid that the other team be go to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it , you do n't deserve to win in the first place .

I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fan , even if the team suck . But this be short term only ; I still do not think the attendance increase will last , unless the team be a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one . Pittsburgh be still get well , so people continue to support them . If they suddenly drop to , say , 50 point , you 'd have knee surgery for some of the people jump off the bandwagon . Ok. My number come from the NHL Guide and Record Book . You can give the credit to Mario since he deserve it . But my point be that it be n't Mario himself , but it be the * expectation * of thing to come ( i.e . a win team ) that he create by be the next great hockey superstar . And before anybody jump in and say I 'm nit-picking and mincing word , go back and read from where this thread start ... It might help to think about what would go through a fan 's mind who suddenly find an interest in Mario and the Pens . Was it `` gee , Mario Lemieux be amazing , I 'll go watch him play '' , or be it `` gee , now we 've get a * kick * * as * guy on * our * side , I 'll go watch him play '' . I think it be the latter . I do n't think this be accurate . The * ticket * sell , but people do n't go to the game . I think this thread have already be discuss ... season ticket holder in LA do n't always use their ticket . So in effect , after the Kings initial success follow Gretzky 's arrival ( 68 to 91 point , same source ) and correspond attendance jump , there have be an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sale may not have change much . Whether or not the Kings be a 'winner ' be debatable . I claim that since Gretzky 's arrival they have at the very least be competitive ... I also claim that McNall have make a stupid move in try to reassemble the Oiler dynasty ... but that 's another story and include only because I do n't like McNall : - ) . Anyway , McNall do do some heavy marketing around Gretzky , and that undoubtedly be also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sale , etc . But as I say , when the Kings have be in there little tailspin over the past couple of year there have be empty seat at the Forum even if the ticket be sell . For the short term , IMO . Although I think that it 's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky , simply because they make people around them better . Well , at least we be in full agreement here ! So be you say Roger have ever have a valid point ? < could n't resist ... > Yes , but they be do no worse than last year . I think the same type of reason I apply to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people show up at Winnipeg game . It 's difficult to predict , but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoff next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance level ? I seriously doubt it , because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be go , with or without Selanne . I do provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL ... do you leave it out because you do n't know much about the CFL ? If that 's the case then fair enough , but if it be n't the case then I 'm curious to hear your explanation . \",\n",

       " \"The FLYERS close out the season last night with their 8th straight victory , a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers . The OT game winner come from Dimitri Yushkevich , just his 5th of the season and his first game winner . The FLYERS never lead up until that point in the game . For the Whalers , the loss mark an NHL record 9th OT loss this season . Roster move : Gord Hynes be call to to play in place of Ryan McGill Injuries : Ryan McGill injure his hand in a fight 4/15 and be scratch . Lines : Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes Dominic Roussel Game Summary : I do n't get TV coverage of the game , and since it be stormy in these part I do n't have the best radio coverage either . Here 's the box score follow by a few thing I do pick up : First Period : Hartford , Nylander 10 , 8:51 Philadelphia , Recchi 53 ( Lindros , Brind'Amour ) , 19:59.8 ( pp ) Penalties - Verbeek , Har ( hold ) , :55 ; Carkner , Phi ( rough ) , 13:53 ; Houda , Har ( interference ) 18:43 Second Period : Hartford , Burt 6 ( Cunneyworth , Kron ) , 2:00 Philadelphia , Bowen 1 ( Eklund , Recchi ) , 7:09 Hartford , Nylander 11 ( Zalapski , Sanderson ) , 9:38 Penalties - Galley , Phi , major-game misconduct ( spear ) :58 ; Verbeek , Har major-game misconduct ( spear ) , :58 ; Brown , Phi ( trip ) , 3:22 ; Zalapski , Har ( trip ) , 15:51 ; Brind'Amour , Phi ( slash ) , 19:50 Third Period : Hartford , Kron 14 ( Sanderson , Cassels ) , 1:24 ( pp ) Philadelphia , Beranek 15 ( Lomakin , Yushkevich ) , 3:11 Philadelphia , Faust 2 ( Brind'Amour , Roussel ) , 3:38 Penalties - Houda , Har ( trip ) , 4:20 ; Hawgood , Phi ( hold ) , 5:30 Overtime : Philadelphia , Yushkevich 5 ( Faust ) , 1:15 . Penalties - None Power Play : Philadelphia 1 of 4 , Hartford 1 of 4 Goalies : Philadelphia , Roussel 14-11-5 ( 30 shot - 26 save ) Hartford , Lenarduzzi , 1-1-1 ( 38 - 33 ) On the first Hartford goal , Gord Hynes misplay the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander strip him and take off . The Recchi goal be a 2 on 1 with Lindros . The Bowen goal be just a puck he throw at the net , get a good carom and it end up behind the goalie . On the second Nylander goal he get three whack at the puck before it go in . This be the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense . Take the body , and if they get one shot and beat you fine . Do n't give them another chance . Carkner , Galley and McGill be all terrible about this , I 'll bet money at least one of them be the closest FLYER to the play . That 's all I have , my radio get bad after that and I be lucky to know who it be that score , much less how . From what I hear , Roussel have a very strong game . After the game , Gene Hart ask Bobby Taylor to pick the three star of the season rather than of the game . It be Garry Galley # 3 for his career high point total ( I 'm surprised that a former goalie would n't look closer at his defensive play ) , Tommy Soderstrom # 2 for his team record tie 5 shutout in only about 1/2 a season and , Mark Recchi # 1 for his all time high team single season score mark . But here 's the odd part . He could n't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1 . If he pick Recchi as # 1 after he have a hard time choose between him and Lindros , do n't that make Lindros # 2 ? ? ? ? What ? You wan na know my three star of the season ? Well , since you ask ... # 1 Eric Lindros . Eric dominate a game simply by step out onto the ice . The difference between the team 's record with him and without him be no accident . I believe that the team could have be almost as successful without Recchi . There be no question that this team be significantly well with Eric Lindros on it , and I think that he will deservedly wear the ' C ' on his jersey next season . # 2 Tommy Soderstrom . 5 shutout be second in the league to only Ed Belfour , and Tommy do n't have a Chris Chelios ( booo ) in front of him . He also do n't play a complete season due to heart problem ( sentimental edge here , my family have a history of heart problem ) . There 's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom be this teams goalie of the future , and if Roussel complain again about be number 2 look for him to be trade within 2 year . # 3 Mark Recchi . Again , you can n't argue with an all-time team high single season score mark . There be an awful lot of team that do n't have a single player get as many point . Plus , Mark be the only FLYER to play the entire season . Not a tough choice . Honorable mention : Rod Brind'Amour top his single season high point total which he set last year . The difference be that he be n't on the top line this year and do n't get as much playing time . Then again , he do n't get the defensive attention that he get last year from the other team either . Dimtri Yushkevich be the team most consistent defenseman . Yes , he make rookie mistake , but he be usually fast enough to make up for them . I have a feeling that with his shot he 'll score a few more point next year without give up anything in his own zone , and I suspect that he 'll be the team top defenseman in year to come . Garry Galley be the team 's point leader from defensemen . Again , there be some thing you just can n't argue with . And he battle with chronic fatigue syndrome , he certainly deserve kudos for only miss one game , and that be against his wish under doctor order . But his defensive play often negate his offensive contribution . A little more caution , and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year . Brent Fedyk be the leagues biggest improvement over last year point total . But consistency become a problem for him . A couple misc note mostly for mail list member : Tom Misnik , a member of the mailing list , would like to exchange E-mail address with any list member who want to keep in touch over the summer . If you 're interested , you can send him mail at : att ! ACR.ORG ! TMISNIK The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place , their best winning percentage since go .500 in 1988-89 . 14-20-3 within the division ( 4th in Patrick ) , 23-14-5 at home . They finish 17th overall , will draft 10th in next year entry draft ( Quebec have the 1st rounder , though ) . They score as many goal as they allow , 319 . The 8 straight win be the most since they win 13 in a row in 1985 . I will be send out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contain them , since there be no more game for me to go to I have no other way of get them . I hope you 've all enjoy this year hockey season as much as I have . Knowing the future that we have come to us make miss the playoff one more time almost bearable .

But it be often fatal , when it happen out of reach of adequate help . More often , it permanently damage one 's health .

And bear this in mind : my wife take the lead in all of these decision . We talk thing over , and I do a lot of the leg work , but the main decision be really hers . I do n't know of very many home birth advocate , even , that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home . But people should bother to find out the relative risk . My wife be unwilling to take any significant risk in order to have nice surroundings . In view of the intensity of the birth experience , I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway . Somehow the value you 're advocate seem all lopsided to me : take risk , even if fairly small , of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that be , after all , an esthetic consideration . -- Mark A.

       " \"I notice several year ago that when I take analgesic fairly regularly , ( motrin at the time ) , I seem to get a lot of migraine . But have forget about that until I start read some of the post here . I generally do n't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headache , because I 've find them to be ineffective . However , I have two other pain source that force me to take NSAIDS ( currently Naprosyn ) . First , be some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period , and then much worse at midcycle . I have have surgery for endometriosis in the past ( ~12 year ago ) , so the Drs . tell me that my pain be probably due to the endometriosis come back . I 've try Synarel , it reduce the pain while I take it ( 3 mo ) , but the pain return immediately after I stop . Three doctor have suggest hysterectomy as the only `` real solution '' to my problem . Although I do n't expect to have any more child , I do n't like the idea of have my uterus and one remain ovary remove ( the first ovary be remove when I have the surgery for endometriosis ) . One of the Drs that suggest I get a hysterectomy be an expert in laser surgery , but perhaps think that type of procedure be only worthwhile on woman who still plan to have child . So basically all I 'm left with be toughing out the pain . This would be impossible without Naprosyn ( or something similar - but not aspirin , that do n't work , and Motrin give me horrible gastritis a few year ago , so I 'm through with it ) . In fact , Naprosyn work very well at eliminate the pain if I take it regularly as I do when I have severe back pain ( and pain in both leg ) as I 'll discuss in a moment . Generally though , I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn , but then it take several hour for it reduce the pain ( it 's actually quite effective at reduce the pain , it just take quite a while ) . In the meantime I 'm frequently in severe pain . The other pain source I have be chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy . I 've have MRIs , Xrays , CT scan , and EMGs ( I 've have 2 of them , and do n't intend to ever do that again ) with nerve conduction test . The test have not be conclusive as to what be cause my back and leg pain . The MRI report both say I have several bulging , degeneratig disk , and from the Xrays ( and MRI , I think ) it be apparent that I have arthritis . The reading on the CT scan be that there be two herniation ( L3-L4 , and L4-L5 ) , but others hav look at the film and conclude that there be no herniation . The second EMG and nerve conduction study show significant denervation compare to the first EMG . Oh yeah , I have some other horrible test , call something like Somatic Evoked Response which show that the `` internal nerve '' be work fine . Anyway , the bottom line be that I sometimes have severe pain in both leg and back pain . The back pain be there all the time , but I can live with it . When the leg pain be there , I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work . So I take Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 month ( every time I try to stop the leg pain get worse , so I 'd always resume ) . Since last November I have take it much less frequently , and primarily for the pelvic pain . I have be go to physical therapy for the last 8 month ( 2-3 time a week ) . After the first month or so , my therapist put me on pelvic traction ( she have try it earlier , but it have cause a lot of pain in my back , this time she try it at a lower weight ) . After a month or two , the pain in my leg begin go away ( but the traction aways cause discomfort in my lower back , which could be reduce with ultrasound and massage ) . So now , I do n't have nearly as much pain in my leg , in fact my therapist take me off traction about 2 week ago . Getting back to my original reason for this post ... Even if I can avoid take analgesic for headache , I really can n't avoid them entirely because I have other pain source , that `` force '' me to use them ( Oh , I forget to mention that it have be suggest to me that I have back surgery , but I 'm avoid that too ) . I find the migraine difficult to deal with , occassionally I have to take off work , but usually I can work , but at a reduced capacity ( I 'm a system engineer and do a lot of reading and write ) . When the pelvic pain be bad , I can n't concentrate much , I usually end up jump out of my chair every few minute , because the pain be so bothersome . When the pain in my back be bad , it can cause severe burning in both leg , shoot pain in my leg , electric shock type of pain in my foot and toe , and basically when it get bad I can n't really sit at all . Then I end up spend most of my time home and in bed . So even if the analgesic contribute to the migraine , the migraine be more tolerable than the other pain source . I get a lot of migraine , an average of 3 to 4 a month , which last 1-3 day . I 've take cafergot ( the first time the caffiene really get to me so I reduce the dosage ) , but I do n't like the side effect ( if I take more than two I get diahrea ) . If I get a very bad headache , I will eventually take the cafergot . My neurologist be n't very helpful when I tell him my problem with cafergot , he say that when sumatriptan becomes available , I should try that . I 've try several other medication ( fiornal , midrin , fiornal with codeine , tegretol , and inderal ) but they either do n't work , or I could n't tolerate them . So what can I do ? My doctor 's seem to be satisfy with me just try to tolerate the pain , which I agree with most of the time , but not when I have a lot of pain . I 've have some bad experience with surgery ( my heart stop once from the anesthesia - I be tell that it be likely the succinylcholine ) , and I 've already have surgery several time . Anyway , the point of what I 'm say be that even if analgesic can contribute to migraine , some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain . Janice Rathmann \",\n",

       " \"I may not be the world 's greatest expert on chigger ( a type of mite indigenous to the south ) , but I certainly have spend a lot of time contemplate the little bugger over the past six year ( since we move to N.C. ) . Here be some observation gain from painful experience : 1 . Reactions to chigger vary greatly from person to person . Some people get tiny red bite . Others ( like me ) be more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affair . 2 . Chigger bite be the gift that keep on give . I swear that these thing will itch for month . 3 . There be a lot of folklore about chigger . I think most of it be fiction . I have try to do research on the critter , since they have such an effect on me . The only book I could find on the subject be a * single * book in UNC 's special collection library . I have not yet go through what be require to get it . 4 . Based on my experience and that of my family member , the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply do n't work . I recall read that the theory upon which it be base ( that the chigger burrow into your skin and continue to party there ) be false . I think it be more likely that the reaction be to toxin of some sort the little pest release . But this be speculation . 5 . The * best * approach be prevention . A couple of thing work well . A good insect repellent ( DEET ) such as Deep Woods Off liberally apply to ankle , waistband , etc . be a good start . There be another preparation call `` Chig Away '' that be a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream ( cortisone ? ) that originally be prepare for the Army and be not commercially available . In the summer I put this on my ankle every morning when I get up on weekend since I literally can n't go outside where we live ( in the country ) without serious consequence . ( They apparently do n't like sulfur much at all . You can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them . ) 6 . No amount of prevention will be * completely * successful . Forget the fingernail polish . I have finally settle upon a treatment that involve topical application of a combination of cortisone creme ( reduce the inflamation and swell ) and benzocaine ( relieve the itch ) . I will n't tell you all the thing I 've try . Nor will I tell you some of the thing my wife do since this count as minor surgery and be best not mention ( I also think it gain nothing ) . 7 . The swell and itch can also be significantly relieve by the application of hot pack , and this seem to speed recovery as well . Doctors seem not to care much about chigger . The urban and suburban doctor apparently do n't encounter them much . And the rural doctor seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure . I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chigger would make a * lot * of money . -- Gary H.

The compiler of this list be NOT a doctor of any kind , but be exercise his First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the subject of his choice . ( MOST of these Remedies can be find in ANY Grocery Store . MOST of the rest of them can be find in ANY Health Food Store . What be important be HOW they be use , and what else be EXCLUDED DURING their use . ) ( 1 ) THE 7-DAY FAST . 1st day : Eat as much fresh fruit as you want , one kind at a time , preferably grape . 2nd day : Eat all the vegetable you want , at least half raw , include GARLIC ; also , whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal lining . 3rd day : Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want . Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounce of prune juice WITH PULP , follow by a gallon of pure ( NOT from concentrate ) apple juice , then grape juice . ( Stay close to your home bathroom . ) 4th day : Eat all the UN-salted nut ( NO peanut ) and dry fruit you want , preferably raisin and almond ( ALMONDS CONTAIN LAETRILE. ) . 5th day : ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE . Squeeze the juice from two lemon into a gallon of water ( preferably distil ) , and add 2 to 4 tablespoon of locally-made honey , ( NO sugar ) . Drink one glass per hour . [ EVERYone , include healthy people , should do this one day every week , precede by a large glass of prune juice WITH PULP . ] 6th day : Same as 5th day . 7th day : Same as 6th day . All 7 day , eat ONLY the food list above for each day , along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplement , plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want . ( 2 ) THE GRAPE DIET . Eat 2 to 3 ounce of fresh grape every 2 hour , 8 AM to 8 PM , every day for six day . Eat NOTHING else during the six day , but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want . ( 3 ) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR . Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar ( NOT apple cider `` flavor '' vinegar . Regular vinegar be HARMFUL . ) in a glass of water ( preferably distil ) and drink all of it . Do this 3 or 4 time per day , for 3 week ; then stop for a week . Repeat if desire . Do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural food . This remedy be especially effective against those type of cancer that resemble a FUNGUS , as well as against other kind of fungus infection . ( 4 ) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH . [ Please keep an OPEN MIND . ] Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level come up almost to the overflow drain when you get in . Immerse yourself in it for a minute , and then completely dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt ( regular salt will n't work . ) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda . Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minute , while exercise your finger , toe , and limb , turn sideways and onto your stomach , dunk your head , sit up and lay back down , chomp your teeth together , etc .. Among other thing , the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralize the accumulated effect of X-rays , etc. , as describe in the book `` Born To Be Magnetic , Vol . 2 '' , by Frances Nixon , 1973 . PRECAUTIONS : Only the ONE person use each bath should prepare it and drain it . For at least 30 minute after take the bath , stay away from , and even out of sight of , other people . ( Your greatly expand Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt other people 's field . ) Two hour after the bath , eat at least 8 ounce of yogurt contain ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures . ( The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also . ) Better yet , take a 2-Billion-bacteria `` Acidophilus '' capsule , which be also an EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF `` A.I.D.S . '' ( because it kill all kind of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract , take a big load off the remain immune system ) . [ Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal bacteria , it may also be a CURE for `` Lyme disease '' . ] Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred mile of a thunder storm , within 3 day of a full moon , nor during `` Major '' or `` Minor Periods '' as list in the `` Solunar Tables '' publish bimonthly in `` Field & Stream '' Magazine , ( because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields present at those time ) . Do NOT take this bath more than four time per year . ( 5 ) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES : For skin cancer , apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the affected skin twice daily , and take 2 to 4 tablespoon per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally , for about 2 month . D.M.S.O . ( Dimethyl Sulfoxide ) cause cancer cell to perform NORMAL cell function . ALMONDS ( UN-blanched , UN-roasted ) CONTAIN LAETRILE . To help prevent cancer , eat several almond every day . To help cure cancer , eat several OUNCES of almond per day . [ NEVER take large concentrated dos of Laetrile orally . IT WILL KILL YOU ! Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY . ( Cancer cell contain a certain enzyme which convert Laetrile into cyanide , which then kill the cell . This enzyme be ALSO present in the digestive system . ) ] ANTI-OXIDANTS be FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS , and include Vitamin E , Selenium ( 200 mcg . per day be safe for most people . ) , Chromium ( up to 100 mcg . per day ) , Vitamin A ( 25,000 IU per day be safe for most people . ) , Superoxide Dismutase ( up to 4,000,000 Units per day ) , Vitamin C ( up to 3000 mg. per day ) , and BHT ( Butylated Hydroxy- toluene ) , [ 1 to 4 capsule of BHT every night at bedtime will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES ( BOTH type ) , suppress herpes symptom if one already have herpes , prevent spread herpes to other people , but will not cure herpes . BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST `` A.I.D.S . '' , which be really a form of cancer similar to leukemia . ] ( See the book `` Life Extension '' , by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw . ) HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE . Dilute twelve ( 12 ) drop of 3 % hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water ( preferably DISTILLED ) and drink it . Do this once or twice per day , hour before or after eat or drink anything else . Apply 3 % hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancer several time per day . Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you be take a good daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants describe above . VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS be more effective , and much less expensive , when COMBINED together in MEGA dose into SINGLE tablet make from NATURAL source . Cancer cell can NOT live in a strong ( 100,000 Maxwell ) NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD , especially if it be pulsate on and off . [ A strong south magnetic field be an aphrodisiac . ] In my opinion , ALL type of ionizing- radiation treatment for cancer should be REPLACED with daily 30-minute dos of pulsate 100,000-Maxwell NORTH magnetic field . Properly make and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES can both diagnose and cure all form of cancer , as well as most other medical problem . Some Radionics/Psionics Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photo of cancer tumor , etc. , with-OUT X-rays ! INTERFERON tablet . TAHEEBO TEA , ( Lapacho ) . HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer , and many other medical problem ( even drug addiction ! ) . 50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure prostate trouble . This list be NOT exhaustive . The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN- DIAGNOSED cancer , as well as PREVENT them , and also prevent and cure many other medical problem include heart- disease . They be NOT too simple and inexpensive to work effectively . Besides act on a person biologically and chemically , these remedy , especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet , send a strong message to one 's subconscious mind , PROGRAMMING it to CURE the cancer . In my opinion , if a person find out that s/he have cancer , then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedy describe above , in sequence ( start with The 7-Day Fast ) , BEFORE resort to the UN-natural and expensive mutilation and agony [ POISON , BURN , and MUTILATE ! ] of orthodox cancer treatment [ organi $ ed-CRIME ! ] .

       " \"In article < 19392 @ pitt.UUCP > geb @ cs.pitt.edu ( Gordon Banks ) write : All true . And all good point . Well , make a career out of it be a bit strong . I still believe that do your own research be very , very necessary . I would not have progress as much as I have today , unless I have spend the many hour in Stanford 's Med Library as I have do . And 5 year ago , it be clear that there be no medicine that would help me . So should I have stop search . Thank goodness I do n't . Now I find that there be indeed medicine that help me . I think that what you 've say be kind of idealistic . That you would go to one doctor , get a diagnosis , maybe get a second opinion , and then move on with your life . Just as an example ... have see 6 of the top specialist in this field in the country , I have receive 6 different diagnosis . These be the top name , the one that people come to from all over the country . I have HAD to sort all of this out myself . Going to a support group ( and in fact , HEADING that support group ) be helpful for a while , but after a point , I find it very unproductive . It be much more productive to do library research , make phone call and put together the piece of the puzzle myself . A recent movie , Lorenzo 's Oil , offer a perfect example of what I 'm talk about . If you have n't see it , you should . It 's not a put down of doctor 's and neither be what I 'm say . Doctors be only human and can only do so much . But there be those of us out here who be intelligent and able to sometimes find a miss piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise go unnoticed . I guess I 'm biased because dizziness be one of those weird thing that be still so unknown . If I have a broken arm , or a weak heart , or fail kidney , I might not have the same opinion . That 's because those thing be much more tangible and have much more concise definition and treatment . With dizziness , you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while try to find your way out of it . I have choose the latter . Linda lindae @ netcom.netcom.com \",\n",

If you can n't ftp , send me mail , and I 'll uuencode and mail them to you ( they 're pretty big ... ) ============== Using a PC 's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issue Mini outline : 1 . Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port 2 . X terminal 3 . NeXT 4 . Silicon Graphics 5 . IBM RS/6000 6 . Other stuff 1 . Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port If you 've get a proprietary computer which use its own keyboard ( Sun , HP , DEC , etc . ) then you 're go to have a hard time find a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard . If your workstation run the X window system , you 're in luck . You can buy a cheap use PC , hook your expensive keyboard up to it , and run a serial cable to your workstation . Then , run a program on the workstation to read the serial port and generate fake X keyboard event . The two main program I 've find to do this be KT and A2X . a2x be a sophisticated program , capable of control the mouse , and even move among widget on the screen . It require a server extension ( XTEST , DEC-XTRAP , or XTestExtension1 ) . To find out if your server can do this , run 'xdpyinfo ' and see if any of these string appear in the extension list . If your server do n't have this , you may want to investigate compile X11R5 , patchlevel 18 or later , or bug your vendor . kt be a simpler program , which should work with unextended X server . Another program call xsendevent also exist , but I have n't see it . Both a2x and kt be available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu . 2 . X terminal Also , a number of X terminal ( NCD , Tektronics , to name a few ) use PC-compatible keyboard . If you have an X terminal , you may be all set . Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the trouble of buy an alternative keyboard . Also , some X terminal add extra button -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key . 3 . NeXT NeXT have announce that new NeXT machine will use the Apple Desktop Bus , mean any Mac keyboard will work . Then , they announce they be cancel their hardware production . If you want any kind of upgrade for an older NeXT , do it now ! 4 . Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics have announce that their newer machine ( Indigo^2 and beyond ) will use standard PC-compatible keyboard and mouse . I do n't believe this also apply to the Power Series machine . It 's not possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboard , except by upgrade the entire machine . Contact your SGI sale rep for more detail . 5 . IBM RS/6000 IBM RS/6000 keyboard be actually similar to normal PC keyboard . || Unfortunately , you can n't just plug one in . You need two thing : a || cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the || smaller PS/2 style DIN-6 , and a new device driver for AIX . Believe || it or not , IBM write this device driver recently , I use it , and it || work . However , they do n't want me to redistribute it . I 've be || tell Judy Hume ( 512 ) 823-6337 be a potential contact . If you learn || anything new , please send me e-mail . || 6 . Other stuff Some vendor here ( notably : Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp ) support some odd keyboard type , and may be responsive to your query regard support your own weird computer . If you can get sufficient documention about how your keyboard work ( either from the vendor , or with a storage oscilloscope ) , you may be in luck . Contact the company for more detail .

Comments : I have a copy of this , and it work as advertised : I would say it be well for RSI prevention than RSI management , because it do not allow break at period less than 30 minute . Also , it interrupt you base on clock time rather than type time , which be not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day . Worked OK on Windows 3.0 though it do occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure why . Also refuse to work with the space bar on one PC , and have one window without window control .

It be also the only tool with a redistributable demo , so if you do get the demo , post it on your local bulletin board , FTP server and Bitnet server ! Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics , but it do have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence , which be good for repeat the most helpful exercise . Tool : Typewatch ( freeware ) , version 3.8 ( October 1992 ) Available from : Email to richardd @ hoskyns.co.uk Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu : pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar Platforms : UNIX ( test on SCO , SunOS , Mach ; character and X Window mode ) Description : This be a shell script that run in the background and warn you to stop typing , base on how long you have be continuously type . It do not provide exercise , but it do check that you really do take a break , and tell you when you can start type again . Typewatch now tell you how many minute you have be type today , each time it warn you , which be useful so you know how much you * really * type . It also log information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out . The warning message appear on your screen ( in character mode ) , in a pop-up window ( for X Windows ) , or as a Zephyr message ( for those with Athena stuff ) . Tim Freeman < tsf @ cs.cmu.edu > have put in a lot of bug fix , extra feature and support for X , Zephyr and Mach . Not formally support , but email richardd @ hoskyns.co.uk ( for SCO , SunOS , character mode ) or tsf @ cs.cmu.edu ( for Mach , X Window mode , Zephyr ) if you have problem or want to give feedback . Tool : Various calendar / batch queue program Available from : Various source Platforms : Various Description : Any calendar/reminder program that warn you of an upcoming appointment can be turn into an ad hoc RSI management tool . Or , any batch queue submission program that let you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen . Using Windows as an example : create a Calendar file , and include this filename in your WIN.INI 's 'load= ' line so you get it on every startup of Windows . Suppose you want to have break every 30 minute , start from 9 be . Press F7 ( Special Time ... ) to enter an appointment , enter 9:30 , hit Enter , and type some text in say what the break be for . Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry , and repeat for the next appointment . By use Windows Recorder , you can record the keystroke that set up break throughout a day in a .REC file . Put this file on your 'run= ' line , as above , and you will then , with a single keypress , be able to set up your daily appointment with RSI exercise . The above method should be adaptable to most calendar program . An example use batch job would be to submit a simple job that run at 9:30 be and warn you to take a break ; this will depend a lot on your operating system . While these approach be not ideal , they be a good way of force yourself to take a break if you can n't get hold of a suitable RSI management tool . If you be techie enough you might want to write a version of Typewatch ( see above ) for your operating system , use batch job or whatever fit best . Tool : Digital watch with count-down timer Available from : Various source , e.g . Casio BP-100 . Description : Many digital watch have timer that count down from a settable number of minute ; they usually reset easily to that number , either manually or automatically . While these be a very basic tool , they be very useful if you be write , reading , drive , or do anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI . The great advantage be that they remind you to break from whatever you be do . Comments : My own experience be that cut down a lot on my typing lead to my write a lot more , and still read as much as ever , which actually aggravate the RSI in my right arm though the left arm improve . Getting a count-down timer watch have be very useful on some occasion where I write a lot in a day . I have try an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer , but these be not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period ! KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS : these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout . One-handed typing tool may help , but be VERY careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you be simply double your hand use for the hand that you use for typing , and may therefore make matter worse . Tool : hsh ( public domain ) Available from : Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu : pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar Platforms : UNIX ( do n't know which one ) Description : Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings . Only work through tty 's ( so , you can use it with a terminal or an xterm , but not most X program ) . Tool : Dvorak keyboard tool ( various ) Available from : Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu : pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c Also build into Windows 3.x . Description : The Dvorak keyboard apparently use a more rational layout that involve more balanced hand use . It * may * help prevent RSI a bit , but you can also use it if you have RSI , since it will slow down your type a * lot * : - ) -- Dan Wallach `` One of the most attractive feature of a Connection dwallach @ cs.berkeley.edu Machine be the array of blink light on the face Office # : 510-642-9585 of its cabinet .

       " \"In article < lsj4gnINNl6c @ saltillo.cs.utexas.edu > turpin @ cs.utexas.edu ( Russell Turpin ) write : As usual , you be miss the whole point , Russell , because you be not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith , which be that science be merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science be to avoid make mistake . This be like say that the most important aspect of business management be accurate bookkeeping . If science be no more than methodology and not make mistake , it would be a poor thing indeed .

I , in particular , think the basic idea of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky . What some of us do believe , however , be that some of these thing ( include some of the flaky idea ) be deserve of serious scientific attention . If in fact it be true , as you have state above , that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what be effective and what be not , then science today would not exist . For all of current science be base on the past work of scientist whose methodology , by current standard , be seriously flaw . It be certainly true that as methodology improves , we need to re-examine those result derive in the past use less perfect methodology . It be also true that the result obtain by people today who still rely on those early methodology need to be re-examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualify to do so credibly . But to say that nobody who fail to do elaborate double-blind study be capable of know their as from a hole in the ground and to say that no idea that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly mark one 's attitude as doctrinaire , cultist .

As soon as you possibly can . The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long , drawn-out ordeal . GO SEE A DOCTOR . Now , your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury . Generally , any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialist in these kind of problem . DO N'T WAIT , THOUGH . GO SEE A DOCTOR . The remainder of this information be paraphrase , without permission , from a wonderful report by New Zealand 's Department of Labour ( Occupational Safety and Health Service ) : `` Occupational Overuse Syndrome . Treatment and Rehabilitation : A Practitioner 's Guide '' . First , a glossary ( or , fancy name for how you should n't have your hand ) : ( note : you 're likely to hear these term from doctor and keyboard vendor : ) RSI : Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kind of injury OOS : Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI CTD : Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI WRULD : Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI CTS : Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ( see below ) Hyperextension : Marked bending at a joint . Pronation : Turning the palm down . Wrist extension : Bending the wrist up . Supination : Turning the palm up . Wrist flexion : Bending the wrist down . Pinch grip : The grip use for a pencil . Ulnar deviation : Bending the wrist towards the little finger . Power grip : The grip use for a hammer . Radial Deviation : Bending the wrist toward the thumb . Abduction : Moving away from the body . Overspanning : Opening the finger out wide . Now then , problem come in two main type : Local condition and diffuse condition . Local problem be what you 'd expect : specific muscle , tendon , tendon sheath , nerve , etc . be inflame or otherwise hurt . Diffuse condition , often mistake for local problem , can involve muscle discomfort , pain , burn and/or tingling ; with identifiable area of tenderness in muscle , although they 're not necessarily `` the problem. & quot ; -- - Why do Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur ? Here 's the theory . Normally , your muscle and tendon get blood through capillary which pass among the muscle fiber . When you tense a muscle , you restrict the blood flow . By the time you 're exert 50 % of your full power , you 're completely restrict your blood flow . Without fresh blood , your muscle use stored energy until they run out , then they switch to anaerobic ( without oxygen ) metabolism , which generate nasty by-product like lactic acid , which cause pain . Once one muscle hurt , all its neighbor tense up , perhaps to relieve the load . This make sense for your normal sort of injury , but it only make thing worse with repetitive motion . More tension mean less blood flow , and the cycle continue . Another by-product of the lack of blood flow be tingle and numbness from your nerve . They need blood too . Anyway , when you 're type too much , you 're never really give a change for the blood to get back where it belong , because your muscle never relax enough to let the blood through . Stress , poor posture , and poor ergonomics , only make thing worse . -- - Specific injury you may have heard of : ( note : most injury come in two flavor : acute and chronic . Acute injury be severely painful and noticable . Chronic condition have less pronounced symptom but be every bit as real . ) Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath . Chronic tenosynovitis occur when the repetitive activity be mild or intermittent : not enough to cause acute inflamation , but enough to exceed the tendon sheath 's ability to lubricate the tendon . As a result , the tendon sheath thickens , get inflame , and you 've get your problem . Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon . Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation . Eventually , the fiber of the tendon start separating , and can even break , leave behind debris which induce more friction , more swelling , and more pain. `` Sub-acute '' tendonitis be more common , which entail a dull ache over the wrist and forearm , some tenderness , and it get worse with repetitive activity . Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerve that run through your wrist into your finger get trap by the inflamed muscle around them . Symptoms include feel `` pin and needle '' , tingle , numbness , and even loss of sensation . CTS be often confuse for a diffuse condition . Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also know as 'neural tension ' , this be where the nerve run down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compress as a result of muscle spasm in the shoulder and elsewhere . AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associate with one of the other OOS disorder . It be largely reversible and can be treat with physiotherapy ( brachial plexus stretch and trigger point therapy ) . Others : for just about every part of your body , there 's a fancy name for a way to injure it . By now , you should be get an idea of how OOS condition occur and why . Just be careful : many inexperienced doctor misdiagnose problem as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome , when in reality , you may have a completely different problem . Always get a second opinion before somebody do something drastic to you ( like surgery ) . ==4== Typing posture , ergonomics , prevention , treatment The most important element of both prevention and recovery be to reduce tension in the muscle and tendon . This require learn how to relax . If you 're under a load of stress , this be doubly important . Tune out the world and breath deep and regular . Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work : every three minute take a three second break . EVERY THREE MINUTES , TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK . Really , do it every three minute . It 's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings , calm down , and relax . If you can n't sleep , you really need to focus on this . Rest , sleep , and relaxation be really a big deal . There be all kind of other treatment , of course . Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain . Custom-molded splint can forcefully prevent bad posture . Surgery can fix some problem . Exercise can help strengthen your muscle . Regular stretching can help prevent injury . Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduce tension . Ice or hot-cold contrast bath also reduce swell . Only your doctor can say what 's best for you . -- - Posture -- here be some basic guideline . [ I so like the way this be write in the New Zealand book that I 'm lift it almost verbatim from Appendix 10 . -- dwallach ] . Let your shoulder relax. . Let your elbow swing free. . Keep your wrist straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - do n't flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try lean back in the chair. . Do n't slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minute , get up and bend your spine backward . Set the seat height , first . Your foot should be flat on the floor . There should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thigh near the knee , and your thigh should not slope too much . Now , draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height be comfortable to work at . If you be short , this may be impossible . The beest remedy be to raise the seat height and prevent your leg from dangle by use a footrest . Now , adjust the backrest height so that your buttock fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan . The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back , so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area . If you operate a keyboard , you will be able to spend more time lean back , so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest , if available . [ Now , I diverge a little from the text ] A good chair make a big difference . If you do n't like your chair , go find a better one . You really want adjustment for height , back angle , back height , and maybe even seat tilt . Most arm rest seem to get in the way , although some more expensive chair have height adjustable arm rest which you can also rotate out of the way . You should find a good store and play with all these chair -- pick one that 's right for you . In the San Francisco Bay Area , I highly recommend `` Just Chairs . '' The name say it all . -- - Keyboard drawer , wrist pad , and keyboard replacement : There be a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right . For some people , wrist pad seem to work wonder . However , with good posture , you should n't be rest your wrist on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be `` right there '' . If you drop your arm at your side and then lift your hand up at the elbow , you want your keyboard under your hand when your elbow be at about 90 degree . Of course , you want to avoid pronation , wrist extension , and ulnar deviation at all cost . Wrist pad may or may not help at this . You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work : how you sit , how you type , and how you relax . It 's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulder or deviate hand . Some argue that the normal , flat keyboard be antiquate and poorly design . A number of replacement be available , on the market , today . Check out the accompany typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail . ==5== Requests for more info Clearly , the above information be incomplete . The typing-injury archive be incomplete . There 's always more information out there . If you 'd like to submit something , please send me mail , and I 'll gladly throw it in . If you 'd like to maintain a list of product or vendor , that would be wonderful ! I 'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendor . I 'd love somebody to make a list of doctor . I 'd love somebody to edit the above section , look for place where I 've obviously goof . ==6== References I completely rewrite the information section here , use a wonderful guide produce in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health Service , a service of their Department of Labour .

I fully agree with you that there be a big distinction between the * process * of science and the end result . As an end result of science , one want to get result that be objectively verifiable . But there be nothing objective about the * process * of science . If good empirical research be do and show that there be some merit to homeopathic remedy , this would certainly be valuable information . But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science . This be where you and I disagree with Turpin . In order to have science , one must have a theoretical structure that make sense , not a mere collection of empirically validate random hypothesis . Experiment and empirical study be an important part of science , but they be merely the culmination of scientific research . The most important part of true scientific methodology be SCIENTIFIC THINKING . Without this , one do not have any hypothesis worth test . ( No , hypothesis do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data . Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you 're shave or look out the window . At least not unless you 've do a lot of really good thinking beforehand . ) The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist do not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology . It depend on the quality of their THINKING . It really bother me that so many graduate student seem to believe that they be do science merely because they be conduct empirical study . And it bother me even more that there be many field , such as certain part of psychology , where there seem to be no thinking at all , but mere study test ad hoc hypothesis .

No experimental result should be accept unless it be describe in sufficient detail to be replicate , and the replication do indeed reproduce the result . No theoretical argument should be accept unless it be present in sufficient detail to be follow , and reasonable , knowlegeable , people agree with the force of the logic . But people try experiment , and pursue argument , for all sort of crazy reason . Irrational motivation be not just curiousities ; they be a large part of the history of science . There be a couple of negative point to make here : 1 ) A theory of qi could , conceivably , become accept without direct verification of the existence of qi . For example , quark be an accepted part of the standard model of physic , with no direct verification . What would be need would be a theory , base on qi , that predict medical reality well than the alternative . The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment , as long as there be a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predict better than any other . ( I would n't hold my breath wait for the triumph of qi , though . I do n't think that there be even a coherent theory base on it , much less a theory that explain anything at all better than modern biology . And it be hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verify the existence of qi . ) 2 ) Science have not historically progress in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence . Most experiment be carry out , and interpret , in pre-existing theoretical framework . The theoretical controversy of the day determine which experiment get do . Overall , there be a huge messy affair of personal jealousy , crazy motivation , petty hatred , and the like that determines which experiment , and which computation , get do . What keep it go forward be the critical function of science : result do n't count unless they can be replicate . The whole system be a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test . The generate part can be totally irrational , as long as the test part work properly . Pasteur could believe whatever he like about chemical activity and crystal ; but even Mitscherlich have to agree that racemic acid crystal be hand ; that when you separate them by handedness , you get two chemical that rotate polarize light in opposite direction ; and the right-rotating version be indistinguishable from tartaric acid . Pasteur 's irrational motivation have lead to a replicable , and important , result . This be where Lysenko , creationists , etc . fail . They have usually not even produce coherent theory that predict much of anything . When their theory do predict , and be contradict by experiment , they do not concede the point and modify their theory ; rather they try to suppress the result ( Lysenko ) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think support their position ( creationists ) . -- Mark A.

       " \"Avoiding mistake be certainly highly desirable . However it be also widely acknowledge that perfectionism be inimicable to creativity . And in ordinary life , perfectionism carry beyond a certain point be indicative of a psychological disorder . In the extreme case , a perfectionist become so paralyze by all the possible mistake he might make that he be unable to even leave the house . In science , we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discovery . Usually there be some trade-off between these two desideratum -- - the search for scope and the search for certainty . If 18th century mathematician have demand total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today , because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really make sense , since they lack the concept of a limit . And in fact , because of the lack of a rigorous foundation , they make a number of error in their use of calculus . It be only a hundred year later that Weistrass be able to give a solid grounding for the idea of Newton and Leibniz . Nonetheless , what Newton and Leibniz do be undoubtedly science and mathematics gain a great deal more from the application of their important idea than it lose through the mistake they make .

According to these poster `` If it 's not support by carefully design control study then it 's not science . '' Taken to the extreme , I believe that the attitude that empirical study be everything and idea be nothing result in a complete stultification of science . For one thing , an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology result in a sort of scientific trade-unionism , where those outside the establishment and lack institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing . ( I do n't in the least believe that this be the intention of the arbiter of scientific methodology . Nonetheless , it be one of the result . ) And although institutional science have certainly produce many wonderful result , I think it be a foolish arrogance for scientist to believe that no one outside the establishment -- - and use less than perfect empirical methodology -- - will ever come with anything worthwhile . Furthermore , the big buck approach to science promotes what I think be one of the most significant error in science : choosing to investigate question because they can be readily handle by the currently fashionable methodology ( or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them ) instead of direct attention to those question which seem to have fundamental significance . For instance , certain question can not be easily investigate with statistical method because the relevant factor be not quantitative . ( One could argue that this be the case for almost all question in many area of psychology . In my opinion , a perusal of many of the paper result from the attempt by psychologist to force these question into a statistical framework give the lie to Russell Turpin 's assertion that current scientific method `` avoid all known error . '' ) I think that ask the wrong question be probably the most fundamental error in science . ( Ignoring potentially valuable idea be one of the others . ) And I think that scientific journal be full of all too many study do with impeccable empirical method but which be worthless because the wrong question be ask in the first place . -- In the argument between behaviorist and cognitivists , psychology seem less like a science than a collection of compete religious sect . lady @ uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady @ uhunix.bitnet \",\n",

However the paragraph above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of `` progress '' and `` rationality '' in science . Since I 've address these issue in this newsgroup in the not too distant past , I will n't go into them again now . What be wrong with the above observation be that it explicitly give the impression ( and you may not in fact hold this view ) that the common ( perhaps even the `` correct '' ) approach for a scientist to follow be to sit around have flight of fancy and scheme on the basis of his jealousy and petty hatred . It far at least implicitly advance the position that sciences go `` forward '' ( and it be not clear what this mean give the context in which it occur ) by generate in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypothesis and theory that be then weed out via the `` critical function '' of science . ( Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational force be a mystery . If experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction be subject to jealousy and petty hatred , then this must be equally true of the application of any `` critical function '' concern replication . This be what lead one ( ala Feyerabend ) to an `` anything go '' view . ) True , the generation part * can * be totally irrational . But typically it be * not * .

Students and professional in the engineering and scientific communitites be encourage to apply for class commence in June 1993 and January 1994 . PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intend to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States . It be also design to let scientist , engineer , and manager experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development . This be facilitate by extended internship in Japanese research facility and laboratory that provide participant with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationship with their Japanese counterpart . PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objective of the program , participant will be require to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture . Correspondingly , JSTMP consist of three major component : 1 . TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language course will be offer , include intensive course design to expedite language preparation for scientist and engineer in a relatively short time . 2 . EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis be place on attain a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approach in manufacturing and information technology . Courses will be available in a variety of department throughout both university include Anthropology , Sociology , History , and Political Science . Moreover , seminar and colloquium will be conduct . Further , a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facility in the United States will be schedule . 3 . AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU , participant will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe , and participate in the management of technology . Internships in Japan will generally run for one year ; however , shorter one be possible .

The crucial thing be not to sit around just have fantasy ; they be n't of any use unless they make you do some experiment . I 've know a lot of scientist whose fantasy lead them on to creative work ; usually they will n't admit out loud what the fantasy be , prior to the consumption of a few beer . ( Simple example : Warren Jelinek notice an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragment . He get very excited , hop that he 'd see some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic gene . This fantasy lead him to sequence sample of the band and carry out bind assay . The result be a well-conserved , 400 or so bp , sequence that occur about 500,000 time in the human genome . Unfortunately for Warren 's fantasy , it turn out to be a transposon that be present in so many copy because it replicate itself and copy itself back into the genome . On the other hand , the characteristic of transposon be much elucidate ; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase be recognize ; and the standard method of recognize human DNA be create . Other specie have different set of transposon . Fortunately for me , Warren and I use to eat dinner at T.G.I . Fridays all the time . ) I 'm not sure that it 's random . But there be no known rational mechanism for generate a rich set of interesting hypothesis . If you be really work in an unknown area , it be unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true ; under those circumstance , the best thing to do be just follow whatever instinct you have . If they be wrong , you will find out soon enough ; but at least , you will find out _something_ . If you try to do experiment at random , with no prior conception at all in mind , you will probably get nowhere . Unfortunately , the critical function do sometimes become hostage to non-rational force . Then we get variety of pathological science : Lysenko , Mirsky 's opposition to DNA-as-gene , cold fusion , and so forth . I do n't agree that this follow . In fact , this be _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend . It be a most important part of the culture of science that one keep one 's jealousy out of the refereeing process . Failures there be aplenty , but , on the whole , thing work out . Another point : there be a couple of sens of the phrase `` experimental design '' . I 'd say that the less rational part be in experimental _choice_ , not design . Alexander Fleming ( Proc . Royal Soc. , 1922 ) choose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reason ( Phage have previously be find in locust diarrhea ; Fleming probably think runny bottom , runny nose , what the hell , it 's worth a try . ) but his method of look for phage be well-designed to detect anything phage-like ; in fact , he find lysozyme . It be not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational .

The problem ( in Type 1 ) be attribute to a genetic mutation where there be a lack of the enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophage so the cell swell up . This will eventually cause death . Enyzme replacement therapy have be successfully developed and approve by the FDA in the last few year so that those patient administer with this drug ( call Ceredase ) report a remarkable improvement in their condition . Ceredase , which be manufacture by biotech biggy company -- Genzyme -- cost the patient $ 380,000 per year . Gaucher 's disease have justifyably be call `` the most expensive disease in the world '' . NEED INFO : I have research Gaucher 's disease at the library but be rely on netlanders to provide me with any additional information : * * news , story , report * * people you know with this disease * * idea , article about Genzyme Corp , how to get a hold of enough money to buy some , program available to help with cost . * * Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER Thanks so very much ! Deborah \"]"
